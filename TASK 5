#### Question 1 ####
     ##########

###WINNERS###
mk = ggplot(season, aes(x= winner))+geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mk)
## out of 25 matches 19 matches won by MI & 6 matches by KKR

pk = ggplot(da, aes(x= winner))+geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(pk)
## in IPL in total MI won 109 matches, KKR 92 matches.

###THUS, CAN CONCLUDE THAT MI is more likely to win.

###WIN BY RUNS###
tk = ggplot(season, aes(x=winner, y = win_by_runs))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(tk)
##average win by runs is higher for KKR than MI

ggplot(da, aes(x=winner, y = win_by_runs))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
##average win by run same 

###WIN BY WICKETS###
tM = ggplot(season, aes(x=winner, y = win_by_wickets))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(tM)
##average win by WICKETS is higher for MI THAN KKR

ggplot(da, aes(x=winner, y = win_by_wickets))+geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))

##CONCLUSION - MI WON MORE MATCHES AGAINST KKR THE GAME PLAYED AS OPPONENT. ALSO, MORE MATCHES IN TOTAL IN IPL IN COMPARISON TO KKR
