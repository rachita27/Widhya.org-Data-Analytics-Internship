#### Question 1 ####
     ##########

##winner##
mk = ggplot(daa_act, aes(x = winner)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mk)
##13 matches MI won & 11 matches KXP

mp = ggplot(daa, aes(x = winner)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mp)
#109 matches MI won & KXP won 82 matches in total

##win_by_runs##
mi = ggplot(daa_act, aes(x = winner, y = win_by_runs)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mi)
##mean win_by_runs higher for KXP than MI

mf = ggplot(daa, aes(x = winner, y = win_by_runs)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mf)
##mean KXP is less than MI in games played in total in IPL

##win_by_wickets##
mu = ggplot(daa_act, aes(x = winner, y = win_by_wickets)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mu)
##mean win_by_wickets is higher for MI than KXP 

mg = ggplot(daa, aes(x = winner, y = win_by_wickets)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(mg)
##mean KXP is higher than MI in games played in total in IPL.

###ON AN AVERAGE THE GAME MI PLAYED AGAINST KXP IS MORE LIKELY TO WIN BECAUSE MI MORE MATCHES WON AGAINST KXP & ALSO IN TOTAL, ALSO AVERAGE WON_BY_WICKETS IS MUCH HIGHER.

#### Question 2 ####

##filtered Q de Kock in dismissed player as he can batsman or non_stiker & as he played very few matches as Member Of MI. Therefore, taking all matches he played in IPL
