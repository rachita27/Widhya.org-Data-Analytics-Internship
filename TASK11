#### Question 1 ####
##########

lpl = ggplot(jkm, aes(x = winner)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(lpl)
##5 matches won by RR & 6 matches won by SH

hjb = ggplot(dai, aes(x = winner)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(hjb)
##RR- 75 matches, SH- 58 matches

hjc = ggplot(jkm, aes(y = win_by_runs, x = winner)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(hjc)
##win by runs is higher for SH=9 than RR=0

hjl = ggplot(jkm, aes(y = win_by_wickets, x = winner)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(hjl)
##win by wicket is higher for RR=6, sh=0

hvc = ggplot(dai, aes(y = win_by_runs, x = winner)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(hvc)
##win by runs is higher for SH than RR, AVG=0,4 resp

hjm = ggplot(dai, aes(y = win_by_wickets, x = winner)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(winner)))
ggplotly(hjm)
##win by wicket is higher for RR than SH, AVG = 4,AVG = 0
##thus more likely that KKR won more matches than RCB in total as well against RCB

##CONCLUSION -much higher win by runs for SH than RR, & also SH won one extra match against RR. Thus, more likely SH win

#### Question 2 ####

dhj = read.csv("deliveries(1).csv")

bn
mgh = summarise(bno, balls_taken_toout = min(ball_no))
mean(mgh$balls_taken_toout) #12.68
median(mgh$balls_taken_toout) #12.5

##conclusion - will take avg 12 & 11

#### Question 3 ####
##########

tye = filter(dhj, bowling_team == "Rajasthan Royals" , batting_team == "Sunrisers Hyderabad", player_dismissed == "DA Warner")

bn = ggplot(tye, aes(x= dismissal_kind))+geom_bar(aes(fill = dismissal_kind))
ggplotly(bn)
##out of 6 MATCHES played against RR in 4 matches he was out by getting caught, 1 - run-out & stumped

tyo = filter(dhj, player_dismissed == "DA Warner")
length(table(tyo$match_id)) # 109 matches he played in total matches in IPL
bnv = ggplot(tyo, aes(x= dismissal_kind))+geom_bar(aes(fill = dismissal_kind))+coord_flip()
ggplotly(bnv)
##OUT OF 109 - 69 TIMES GET CAUGHT, 23- BOWLED, STUMPED - 5, RUN-OUT = 6, LBW = 4, HIT-WKT =1, CAUGHT & BOWLED=2
###CONCLUSION - SO CAN SAY MORE LIKEY IS GETTING CAUGHT

##########
#### Question 4 ####
##########

tye = filter(dhj, bowling_team == "Sunrisers Hyderabad" , batting_team == "Rajasthan Royals")

bv = tye %>% group_by(match_id, batsman)          
nkm = summarise(bv, run = sum(total_runs))
by(nkm, nkm["run"], head, n=4)
mny = nkm %>% group_by(match_id, batsman) %>% summarise(max(run))
nkm = arrange(nkm, match_id, desc(run) )

mko = slice(nkm,1:2) ##top 2 positions
table(mko$match_id)
length(table(mko$batsman)) ##played 11 matches 
table(mko$batsman)
#SV samson 6 times in top 2, & AM rahane 4 times in top 2

mkd = slice(nkm,1)  ##first position
table(mkd$batsman) # 3 times AM RAHANE & SV SAMSON top 1

##implies out of 6 times - 3 times SV SAMSON topped & 3 times second position
##& out of 4 times- 3 times topped & 1 second position

##CONCLUSION - thus can say more likely that SAMSON to score most runs for RR in match

#### Question 5 ####
##########

teamd = c("Sunrisers Hyderabad", "Rajasthan Royals")

tyb = filter(dhj, bowling_team %in% teamd , batting_team %in% teamd, noball_runs %!in% 0)
mf = group_by(tyb,match_id)
mk = count(mf,noball_runs) #1 no_ball
##out of 11 matches played only in 3 matches only one no ball in each match
###CONCLUSION - ONE NO BALL
